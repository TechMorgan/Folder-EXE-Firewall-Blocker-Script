# Folder EXE Firewall Blocker BAT Script

- This script blocks every exe file available on the folder you choose. It also includes subfolders as per your choice. 
- I created this mainly for blocking pirated softwares from accessing the internet. <!-- But I'm not using them -->  
- You can block them in inbound or outbound or both.  
- You can also set custom name for the rules.
- __Run it as admin and go on.__
